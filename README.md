# Sup World Syscall
A project completed in CMSI 387: Operating Systems where I modified Ubuntu 16.04 to include a custom system call that prints "Sup World" to the system log. To demonstrated I successfully created the `sup world` syscall, I was to create a How-To guide, documenting the steps taken to complete the project.
