<h1 align="center">Sup World Syscall</h1>

<p>A project completed in CMSI 387: Operating Systems where I modified Ubuntu 16.04 in VirtualBox to include a custom system call that prints "Sup World" to the system log. To demonstrated I successfully created the <code>sup world</code> syscall, I was to create a How-To guide, documenting the steps taken to complete the project.</p>
